# 1. Fibonacci.
# Implement a function that calculates the Fibonacci serie until a given number "n"
# ex: fib(15) with return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

    def fib(n):
        pass
    

# 2. Capitalize.
# Given a multi word string, return the same string with all first letter as uppercase.
# ex: cap("my name is john") with return "My Name Is John"

    def cap(word):
        pass
    

# 3. Matrix.
# Think about how would you implement a matrix using lists.
# 1. Given a 3x2 matrix, loop over all elements and print them.
# 2. Given a square matrix, print its diagonal.

# 4.Priority queue. Interface:

Implement a priority queue with the following interface.

    def create_queue():
        # Creates and returns an empty priorty queue
        pass
     
    def add_element_to_queue(queue, element, priority):
        # Adds the element to the queue with the given priority
        pass
     
    def next_element(queue):
        # returns (and removes) the next element in the queue.
        pass


# 5. Multidict
You want to make a dictionary that maps keys to more than one value (a so-called "multidict").
Proposed interface: (you can think your own)

    def create_multidict():
        pass
    def add_element(dict, key, element):
        pass
